# Sentiment Analysis using BERT

This repository contains a project for sentiment analysis using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The project involves training a BERT model to classify text data into positive and negative sentiments. The project is implemented using PyTorch and the `transformers` library by Hugging Face.

## Introduction

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. This allows the model to learn a wide range of language understanding tasks using a simple fine-tuning step.

The BERT model has achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, question answering, and text classification.

## Approach

The approach for this project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load the training and test data from TSV files, and preprocess the text data using the BERT tokenizer.
2. **Dataset and DataLoader:** Create a custom dataset class and use DataLoader for batching and shuffling the data.
3. **Model Definition:** Define the BERT model for sequence classification.
4. **Training and Evaluation:** Train the model on the training data, evaluate it on the validation data, and save the best model.
5. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data and save the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-bert.git
cd sentiment-analysis-bert
```

2. **Prepare the Data:**

Place your training data (`train-1.tsv`) and test data (`test_YourLastName_UID-1.tsv`) in the repository directory.

3. **Run the Training Script:**

```bash
python train.py
```

4. **Run the Prediction Script:**

```bash
python predict.py
```

## Model Training and Evaluation

The training script (`train.py`) includes functions for training and evaluating the model. It uses a custom dataset class to handle the text data and a DataLoader for batching. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer and cross-entropy loss function. The training process includes periodic evaluation on the validation set, and the best model is saved based on validation loss.

## Prediction on Test Data

The prediction script (`predict.py`) loads the trained model and makes predictions on the test data. The predictions are saved in a TSV file.

## Results

The results of the sentiment analysis, including accuracy and F1 score, are printed during training and evaluation. The final predictions on the test data are saved in `test_YourLastName_UID_predictions.tsv`.
